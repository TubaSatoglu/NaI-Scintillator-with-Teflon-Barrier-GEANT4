# Geant4 Detector Simulation

This repository contains Geant4-based simulations for particle interactions with different detector configurations.  
Each project demonstrates geometry definition, physics list configuration, primary generator setup, and action initialization.  
In some cases, Pythia8 is also used to generate primary events for proton-proton collisions.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Geometry Definition
Implemented in **PMDetectorConstruction.cc/hh**.  
- Builds the **scintillator detector volume** (plastic or NaI depending on the project).  
- Surrounds it with **Teflon or Aluminium barriers** for optical reflection.  
- Defines material properties and optical surfaces.  
- Placement and visualization attributes are set to allow tracking of optical photons and primary particles.  

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Physics List
Defined in **PMPhysicsList.cc/hh**.  
- Uses the **FTFP_BERT_HP** physics list, which includes:  
  - Electromagnetic processes  
  - Hadronic interactions  
  - Optical photon processes (scintillation, absorption, boundary reflections)  
- Additional physics lists can be substituted depending on the detector study.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Action Initialization
Defined in **PMActionInitialization.cc/hh**.  
- Registers user-defined actions:  
  - **PMRunAction** ‚Üí Simulation-level setup and run summary  
  - **PMEventAction** ‚Üí Records energy deposition per event  
  - **PMSteppingAction** ‚Üí Tracks optical photons step-by-step  
  - **PMSensitiveDetector** ‚Üí Detects photon hits on sensitive surfaces

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Primary Generator Action
Defined in **PMPrimaryGenerator.cc/hh**.  
- Configures the particle gun.  
- For scintillator tests: alpha or gamma particles are generated at defined positions and energies.
- Allows selection of particle type, energy, and emission angle.
